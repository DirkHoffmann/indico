Workflows and Actors in Indico events
======================================

While Indico allows in the simplest case a single person to create and
event, draft the timetable, upload the contributions and presentation
slides and write the minutes, a more cooperative management style is 
mostly adopted for meetings beyond a certain size.
This chapter outlines the various concepts of "workflow" that are used
in Indico events.

The chapters of these Quick Start Guides are ordered as there actions
appear in the normal life of a conference contribution.

1. A possible conference contribution is entered into an Indico conference
in the form of an **abstract** by a person called **submitter**.

2. An abstract is usually assigned to one or more tracks of the
conference. A person called **track co-ordinator** will read the abstract 
and recommend acceptation or rejection of the abstract. It is also
possible to propose merging of one or more abstracts.

3. The **session manager** can accept any abstract, 
which has been proposed for acceptation. The abstract then becomes a
**contribution**. A session manager may manage several sessions, which are
related to each other.

4. Once an abstract has been accepted as a contribution, it should not
be modified any more. Instead the contribution is the element to be
modified, updated and completed in Indico. This is done by the
**contribution manager**, which may or may not be the same as the
**submitter**.

5. The **session co-ordinator** can arrange the final schedule of the
session, within the given timetable limits, with the assigned contributions
and the possibility to add breaks. He is usually called "session
chairman".


**Notes**:

Track co-ordinators and session managers can be the same person.

Abstracts can be accepted in any session, regardless of
the track to which they have been attributed. 

The cooperation between
different tracks and sessions should be organised and agreed
"offline", regardless of what Indico technically permits. 
They often are a matter of traditional procedure for a given conference.

The conference manager can carry out and override 
any of the actions mentioned above any time.
